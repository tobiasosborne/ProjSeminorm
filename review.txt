* I didn't make progress on the actual question. It created a CounterExample.lean file, but stated truthfully that it had no counterexample.

* It seems to know my email, but I couldn't find the file dgemail.txt in the repository?

* It did look at our PR, but still re-implemented functions we had already proven. Let me compare.

I think our isLUB function

is nicer. It's shorter and also works for semilinear maps, where the AI version fails.

However, I think that the AI's exists_norming_seq is slightly better than ours

It uses `(Set.range_nonempty _)` which is a lighter-weight and more generic proof of non-emptiness than our ⟨0, ⟨0, by simp⟩⟩. It also used `obtain` where I used `choose`. Both work, but I guess in that context, `obtain` is slightly better. I've taken the liberty of copying these idioms! 🙂

Our `projectiveSeminorm_tprod_of_bidual_iso` is much more concise (Davood and me did spent quite some time on making it nice).

* In HANDOFF.MD, it described "A Slightly Better Duality Bound". Here, "better" means "weaker assumptions", not "tighter". It's a weakening we knew was possible, but didn't include to keep the proof simpler. But it's still impressive that it found it. It's a genuine strengthening of the mathematical result that we did not mention in our files.


Verdict:

Quite impressive as a tool!!

It's a bit confusing that it reimplemented functions we already wrote. So I don't know how independent these solutions are.

It didn't really attempt the part that would have required some mathematical creativity.

Have you considered using it as a tool to comment on existing files, rather than creating its own proofs? For me, the slight improvements it suggested to `isLUB_opNorm` was the most useful part. (Apparently, one can now request AI reviews for PRs on GitHub -- though I haven't tried and I think it's a generic model).
