CC'ing in Davood.

Tobias, should we run a test?

Check out https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33969

Background is that we found a "misformalization" in Mathlib: The theory billed as referring to the injective tensor norm doesn't actually talk about that norm at all. So, on and off, we've been working on re-implementing the projective and the injective tensor norms. Fun stuff.

Now look at this "TBD item" left by the original author in line 33:

https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Module/PiTensorProduct/ProjectiveSeminorm.lean

It asks for a proof that the projective seminorm is multiplicative, assuming that the normed spaces embed isometrically into their biduals.

Davood and me have since proven that, see `projectiveSeminorm_tprod_of_bidual_iso` in `ProjectiveSeminorm.lean` in

https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33969/changes#diff-d5902c065defb57326cdb9a13b821fb767f55596a9d32efb180449836152b62cR431

But I've been wondering whether this is true unconditionally. More concretely, I wonder whether the proof of Prop. 17.4 (with the essence contained in Lemma 17.3 specialized to `m=1`) of these notes

https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/pschnei/publ/lectnotes/nfa.pdf

can be adapted. (Warning: The doc is about "ultrametric spaces" -- these are supremely confusing to the uninitiated, like me. If the idea can be translated, it would have to be modified quite significantly).

I've started a LaTeX doc to see whether that works, but haven't found the time to work on it since.


Wouldn't that be a good test case for a swarm of AI agents?

* The question is well-defined and already formalized: "Remove `h_bidual` in the proof of `projectiveSeminorm_tprod_of_bidual_iso`"

* I'm genuinely not sure whether it's true, and I haven't found literature on it. (By Hahn-Banach, the statement is true for spaces over RR and CC, which is what all the books are about).

* There's a concrete lead, Prop. 17.4 above.

* If your AI proves it, I volunteer my (and Davood's :-)) time to clean up the slop and PR it to Mathlib in our names.

* If your AI finds a counterexample, I owe you big time!!

What do you think?
