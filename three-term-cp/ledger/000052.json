As established by critical challenge ch-d076e166088 on node 1.1, the correct formulation involves two independent norms N_E and N_F, giving cost:\n\n  C = N_E(s/D-alpha*a,-alpha*b)*N_F(p,q) + N_E(-q/D-beta*a,-beta*b)*N_F(r,s) + N_E(a,b)*N_F(alpha*p+beta*r,alpha*q+beta*s)\n\nThe single-norm search is SOUND for disproving CP: if C(N,N) \u003c 1 for some N and some parameters, then (E,F) = (Cp^2,N) x (Cp^2,N) is a valid counterexample to the universal CP statement. So the claim 'This would disprove CP' is correct.\n\nHowever, the search is INCOMPLETE for the following reason: if C(N,N) \u003e= 1 for all N and all parameters (i.e., Case A holds for the single-norm problem), counterexamples might still exist with N_E != N_F. The two-norm optimization landscape has strictly more degrees of freedom. A thorough counterexample search should also consider N_E != N_F.\n\nThis is rated minor because (a) the node's logical claim is correct, and (b) the two-norm gap is already tracked at nodes 1.1 and 1.3. However, the node should acknowledge this limitation to guide the search strategy.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
