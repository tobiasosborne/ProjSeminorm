Per node 1.3.1 (validated), the CP conjecture involves two INDEPENDENT norms N_E and N_F on k^2. The claim refers only to 'ultrametric geometry' and 'the p-adic valuation' as if a single norm structure governs the landscape. When N_E and N_F are distinct chain norms with different chain parameters (lambda_n^E, r_n^E) vs (lambda_n^F, r_n^F), the jump loci for T_1 = N_E(v_1)*N_F(w_1) depend on BOTH chains: T_1 as a function of b has jump loci from N_E (via the v_1 argument) but NOT from N_F (since w_1 = (p,q) does not depend on b). Similarly T_2 has jump loci from N_E only. T_3 has jump loci from N_E (via (a,b)) but NOT from N_F. So in the perturbative approach, only N_E's chain structure determines the jump loci in b. This means N_F enters only through the FIXED multiplicative factors N_F(p,q), N_F(r,s), N_F(alpha*p+beta*r, alpha*q+beta*s), which are part of the 7-parameter optimization. The claim should make this distinction explicit, as it affects the feasibility assessment: the N_F degrees of freedom add 3 extra continuous parameters (from the chain defining N_F) to the outer optimization.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
