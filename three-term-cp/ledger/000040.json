This is a tautology of classical logic; it holds for ANY predicate P and carries zero mathematical content.\n\nAs a proof node of type \"claim\", node 1.3 should assert something substantive that advances the proof. Instead, it merely restates the problem as a dichotomy that holds trivially. Nodes 1.4 (Case A) and 1.5 (Case B) already state the two possibilities directly; node 1.3 adds nothing that isn't already expressed by the conjunction \"either 1.4 is true or 1.5 is true.\"\n\nA substantive case split would partition the parameter space into regions where different proof strategies apply (e.g., \"split on whether |alpha|N(w1) \u003e= |beta|N(w2)\") or invoke a structural lemma to reduce to finitely many cases. This node does neither.\n\nConsequence: Node 1.3 can be removed or archived without any loss to the proof structure. Nodes 1.4 and 1.5 are self-contained as alternative approaches to the root conjecture.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
