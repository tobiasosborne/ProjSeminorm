The formula uses the expressions 's/D' and '-q/D' where D is never defined within the statement of this node. From the context of sibling node 1.2, D = ps - qr, and the condition ps \\!= qr ensures D \\!= 0 (hence division is well-defined). The variable D should be explicitly defined in the statement for self-containedness. Additionally, the formula implicitly requires N(1,0) = 1 (since the reduction in 1.1 normalizes ||e_1|| = 1 and the parametrization in 1.2 sets e = e_1 = (1,0)), but this normalization constraint on N is not stated.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
