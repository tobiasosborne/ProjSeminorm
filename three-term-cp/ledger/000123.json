From context it must be N(0,1) = N(e₂), but this should be stated explicitly.\n\n2) The a=0 specialization is proposed as a search direction, but no analysis is given of whether C \u003c 1 is achievable. A brief feasibility check:\n\n   With a=0: C = N(1,-αb) + |β|·|b|·r₀² + |b|·r₀·N(α,β).\n\n   In the ultrametric setting, the first term satisfies:\n   - If |αb|·r₀ \u003c 1: N(1,-αb) = max(1, |αb|·r₀) = 1 by isosceles, so C = 1 + (positive terms) ≥ 1.\n   - If |αb|·r₀ \u003e 1: N(1,-αb) = |αb|·r₀ \u003e 1, so C \u003e 1.\n   - If |αb|·r₀ = 1: N(1,-αb) ≤ 1 with possible cancellation, so N(1,-αb) could be \u003c 1. But the other two terms are non-negative and both involve |b|·r₀ \u003e 0 (assuming b ≠ 0), so they push C back up.\n\n   In the cancellation case: |αb|·r₀ = 1 implies |b| = 1/(|α|·r₀). Then:\n   T₂ + T₃ = |β|·r₀²/(|α|·r₀) + r₀/(|α|·r₀)·N(α,β)\n            = |β|·r₀/|α| + N(α,β)/|α|\n\n   Since N(α,β) ≥ |α| (because N(1,0)=1 so N(α,β) ≥ |α|·N(1, β/α) ≥ |α|·... hmm, actually N(α,β) ≥ |α| is not obvious for all norms). The feasibility of C \u003c 1 depends on whether the savings from cancellation in the first term can exceed the cost of the remaining terms. This analysis is absent from the node.\n\n3) The direction \"Minimize over α,β,b in ℂ_p\" is stated without specifying which norm N is used (pathological chain norm? sup norm? arbitrary?). Different norms give radically different optimization landscapes.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
