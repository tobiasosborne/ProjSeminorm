But the ultrametric local constancy that the claim invokes works AGAINST the perturbative idea: for any fixed choice of the other 7 parameters (alpha,beta,a,p,q,r,s), the cost C(b) is CONSTANT in a full ultrametric neighborhood of b=0.\n\nProof: For the chain norm N(x,y) = max(|x|/r_inf, sup_n |x + lambda_n y|/r_n), evaluate T_1 = N_E(s/D - alpha*a, -alpha*b) at b=0: each term in the sup becomes |s/D - alpha*a|/r_n, and the max is some fixed value M_1. For |b| sufficiently small (specifically |alpha*b*lambda_n| \u003c |s/D - alpha*a| for all n in the chain), the ultrametric inequality gives |s/D - alpha*a - alpha*lambda_n*b| = |s/D - alpha*a| for all n, so T_1 is unchanged. Similarly T_2. For T_3 = N_E(a,b)*N_F(alpha*p+beta*r, alpha*q+beta*s), as long as |b| is small enough relative to |a| (specifically |lambda_n*b| \u003c |a| for all n), N_E(a,b) = N_E(a,0) = |a|*N_E(1,0). So all three terms are constant for small b.\n\nConsequence: C(b) = C(0) = 1 for all b in a neighborhood of 0. The 'first jump' occurs at a SPECIFIC threshold b_0 depending on all other parameters. To execute the approach, one must:\n(1) Compute b_0 explicitly as a function of (alpha,beta,a,p,q,r,s) and the chain parameters\n(2) Evaluate C(b_0) \n(3) Optimize over (alpha,beta,a,p,q,r,s) to minimize C(b_0)\n\nStep (3) is a 7-dimensional optimization problem over a non-archimedean field — essentially the SAME numerical search as node 1.5.4 (which is already being pursued). The 'discrete jump' observation provides no analytical leverage for reducing this search. The claim's unique contribution — that one need only check finitely many jump values of b for each fixed parameter tuple — is correct but does not make the 7-dimensional outer optimization tractable.\n\nMoreover, near the accumulation point b_inf = (s/D - alpha*a)/(alpha*lambda_inf) of the chain's jump loci, there are infinitely many jumps in any neighborhood, so the 'discrete' picture requires careful handling at accumulation points.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
