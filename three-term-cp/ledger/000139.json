A meaningful numerical experiment over C_p faces serious obstacles:\n\n(1) CHAIN SPECIFICATION: The pathological norm N(x,y) = r_inf * sup_n |x + lambda_n*y| / r_n requires an explicit chain (lambda_n, r_n). The node proposes 'qn converging to sqrt(2)' which is incoherent (see critical challenge). A valid chain must use a pseudo-convergent sequence in C_2 with no limit in C_2. Constructing such a sequence explicitly requires working in the algebraic closure of Q_2, which is computationally expensive.\n\n(2) NORM EVALUATION: Computing N(x,y) = r_inf * sup_n |x + lambda_n*y|_2 / r_n requires either (a) truncating the chain at some finite n=M, introducing systematic bias (the sup over a finite set may be \u003c the true sup), or (b) proving that the chain stabilizes for each (x,y), which requires case-by-case analysis.\n\n(3) PARAMETER SPACE: The cost function has 8 real parameters (over C_2, which is infinite-dimensional over Q_2). Discretizing effectively over a non-archimedean field requires choosing elements from the value group/residue field structure, not a uniform grid.\n\n(4) WHAT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL: A useful numerical experiment would need to (a) fix a concrete chain of length M \u003e= 10, (b) use exact arithmetic in Q_2(sqrt(2)) or a finite extension, (c) sample parameters from p-adic lattice points, (d) minimize C over the parameter space using Nelder-Mead or similar derivative-free method adapted to the ultrametric topology, (e) report the minimum found and its location. None of this is specified.\n\n(5) INTERPRETIVE LIMITATION: Even finding C=1 everywhere on a grid does not prove C \u003e= 1 universally. The infimum could be achieved at non-grid points. Conversely, finding C \u003c 1 at any point would immediately disprove CP. So the experiment is asymmetric: it can disprove but not prove CP.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
