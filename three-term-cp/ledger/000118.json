The unresolved equality cases in this strategy are the v-side dual of the w-side obstruction in node 1.4.2.4. Specifically: (A) Node 1.4.2.4 identifies that N(alpha*w_1 + beta*w_2) \u003e= |alpha|*N(w_1) fails when |alpha|*N(w_1) = |beta|*N(w_2) (cancellation in the w-sum). (B) This node's equality case requires bounding N_E(c_1*e_1 - alpha*v_3) when |c_1| = |alpha|*N_E(v_3) (cancellation in the v-difference). Both arise from the same fundamental phenomenon: ultrametric cancellation at equal-norm terms. A viable strategy for the 3-term CP inequality likely needs to handle BOTH cancellation phenomena simultaneously, possibly through a combined constraint relating the v-side and w-side cancellation via the tensor equation e_1 tensor e_1 = sum v_j tensor w_j. Strategies that analyze T_1, T_2, T_3 independently cannot capture this coupling.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
