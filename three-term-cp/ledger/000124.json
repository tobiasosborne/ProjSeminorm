The tensor equation is automatically satisfied by the parametrization — no additional constraints arise from setting a=0.\n\n(An earlier analysis suggested a=0 forces v₁=(1,0), v₂=(0,0), making the representation trivial. This was based on an algebraic error: incorrectly substituting a=0 into the second component of v₁, which is -αb and does NOT depend on a.)\n\nThe a=0 subspace is therefore a legitimate 3-parameter search space (α,β,b) for potential counterexamples with C \u003c 1.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
