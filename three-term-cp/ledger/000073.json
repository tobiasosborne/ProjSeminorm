Let k be a nontrivially valued field and let N_E, N_F be norms on k² satisfying N_E(1,0) = N_F(1,0) = 1. For all α,β,a,b,p,q,r,s ∈ k with D := ps - qr ≠ 0, prove that N_E(s/D - αa, -αb) · N_F(p,q) + N_E(-q/D - βa, -βb) · N_F(r,s) + N_E(a,b) · N_F(αp + βr, αq + βs) ≥ 1. STATUS: This is genuinely open. The collinear case (all wⱼ parallel, i.e., 1-term dependent representations) and the independent case ({wⱼ} linearly independent) are proved sorry-free for all valued fields. The 3-term dependent case (this node) requires new techniques: the standard Hahn-Banach/duality approach fails because (1) FDNP is false over non-spherically-complete fields like ℂ_p for certain norms, so the bidual isometry h_bidual is unavailable in general, and (2) the claim must hold for ALL pairs of norms (N_E, N_F), not just specific pathological ones. The normalization N_E(1,0) = N_F(1,0) = 1 comes from the reduction in node 1.1 (WLOG e = e₁). The variable D = ps - qr is the determinant of the basis change matrix [p,q;r,s] from node 1.2.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"953bb395d14e77bb2de72062574bc5732bc1291e465653700e2532ad57820e4e","created":"2026-02-10T11:15:54.066989971Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
