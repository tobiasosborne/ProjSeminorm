(a) 'The ultrametric norm N is piecewise-linear on the Berkovich skeleton' conflates two different objects: the norm N: k² → ℝ≥0 (a function on k-points) and the associated point η_N of the Berkovich analytification of P¹_k (which represents a multiplicative seminorm on the polynomial ring). The norm N determines a SINGLE point on the Berkovich space, not a function on it. What is piecewise-linear on the Berkovich skeleton is the function η ↦ -log|f|(η) for a fixed polynomial f, not the norm as a function of its argument. The node appears to be describing the tropical behavior of N(a,b) as (a,b) varies, which is a statement about the tropicalization of the norm function, not about the Berkovich skeleton per se. (b) The claim is stated for 'the ultrametric norm N' (definite article) but the parent node 1.4 already received challenge ch-f0eb8f565277e532 about this ambiguity. Even restricting to one norm, the piecewise-linear description applies only to norms of the specific 'empty-intersection chain' form; general ultrametric norms on k² (which arise in the two-norm setting) need not have this tropical structure.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
