This inequality is a HARD FLOOR.\n\nThe 3-term cost is:\n  C = N_E(c1*e1 - alpha*v3)*N_F(w1) + N_E(c2*e1 - beta*v3)*N_F(w2) + N_E(v3)*N_F(alpha*w1+beta*w2)\n\nFor C \u003c 1, we need the first two terms to decrease below the collapsed cost AND the third term not to compensate. The ONLY mechanism for decrease is ultrametric cancellation in the N_E-factors: N_E(c1*e1 - alpha*v3) \u003c |c1| when |c1| = |alpha|*N_E(v3). This cancellation depends on the NORM N_E and the VECTOR v3, NOT on N_F(w_j) being small.\n\nThe node's proposed mechanism (making N_F(w_j) small) does not address the actual driver of potential C \u003c 1. Even if N_F(w_j) were tiny, it multiplies N_E(v_j) which would be correspondingly large (by the 2-term lower bound), and C \u003e= 1 holds generically. The actual open question (ultrametric cancellation in the equal-max case |c_j| = |alpha/beta|*N_E(v3)) is studied in nodes 1.4.2.3-1.4.2.4 and is INDEPENDENT of the w-norm magnitudes.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
