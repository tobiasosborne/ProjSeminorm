The ultrametric inequality N(x+y) \u003c= max(N(x), N(y)) is a specific axiom. The isosceles property (N(x+y) = max(N(x), N(y)) when N(x) != N(y)) is a theorem. The discreteness of the value group |k*| for a local field is a property of k, not of N. \"Rigidity\" could refer to any of these, or to the broader phenomenon that ultrametric norms on finite-dimensional spaces are more constrained than archimedean ones.\n\nA precise statement should specify which property of non-archimedean norms is being invoked, e.g., \"the ultrametric inequality N(x+y) \u003c= max(N(x), N(y))\" or \"the isosceles property of ultrametric norms\". Since this node is a tautological case split (see companion challenge), no specific property is actually being invoked, which makes the imprecision moot -- but if the node is amended to contain substantive content, the terminology should be made precise.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
