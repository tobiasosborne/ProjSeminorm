Node 1 asserts: (A) For ALL valued fields k, ALL normed k-spaces E,F, the 3-term dependent cost \u003e= ||e||*||f||. 'Equivalently': (B) the 3-term CP holds over (Cp^2, N) with the specific pathological norm. Direction A=\u003eB is trivial. The reverse B=\u003eA has three gaps: (1) After valid reduction, E reduces to (k^2, N_E) and F to (k^2, N_F) with TWO INDEPENDENT norms. The correct cost is C = N_E(c1e-av3)*N_F(w1) + N_E(c2e-bv3)*N_F(w2) + N_E(v3)*N_F(aw1+bw2). Statement (B) studies only N_E=N_F=N, missing potential counterexamples with N_E \\!= N_F. (2) Even with N_E=N_F, no argument shows the pathological norm is extremal among all non-archimedean norms on k^2. (3) The field is fixed to Cp but (A) quantifies over all valued fields. The word 'Equivalently' should be 'In particular' unless a full reduction is supplied. The first sentence (the universal claim) is well-formed as a conjecture; only the equivalence assertion is challenged. See also ch-d076e166088 on node 1.1 which identifies the same E=F gap at the reduction level.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
