But the collinear case dim(span{w1,w2,w3}) = 1 is also a '3-term dependent representation' and is NOT covered (D = 0 for every labeling).\n\nAdditionally, for genuinely 3-TERM representations (all terms nonzero), the constraints (alpha,beta) != (0,0) and (a,b) != (0,0) are needed but not stated.\n\nSUGGESTED FIX: Replace 'Every 3-term dependent representation' with 'Every 3-term dependent representation with dim(span{w1,w2,w3}) = 2'. The collinear case is handled separately (CancellationTrick.lean).\n\nNOTE: The core algebra and cost formula are verified CORRECT. This challenge concerns only the quantifier precision.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
