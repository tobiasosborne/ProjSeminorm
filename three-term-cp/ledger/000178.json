In ultrametric geometry, C jumps discretely. Check if any discrete jump lands below 1. The p-adic valuation discretizes the landscape.","new_statement":"APPROACH B3: PERTURBATIVE ANALYSIS. At b=0, C=1 (collinear case, proved). For ultrametric N_E, C(b) is piecewise constant in b for fixed other parameters, with jump loci determined by N_E's chain structure. Local constancy at b=0 means C remains 1 in a full ultrametric neighborhood — the first potential decrease occurs at a computable threshold b_0. However, determining whether C dips below 1 at b_0 requires joint analysis of all 8 parameters and the norm pair (N_E, N_F), which is the full counterexample search problem. This observation provides structural insight (the search space is piecewise constant with finitely many cells per parameter box) but no direct analytical reduction.","owner":"prover-wave12-node1.5.3"}
