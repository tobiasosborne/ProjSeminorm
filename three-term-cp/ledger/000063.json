A key test case: the Cross Property π(e⊗f) = ‖e‖‖f‖ for 3-term representations over (Cₚ², N) with the pathological norm N. This test case is a necessary condition (if CP fails over some valued field, reduction to k² with some norm N_E on E and N_F on F gives a counterexample; testing specific norms on Cₚ² can detect such failures) but is not known to be equivalent to the universal statement without further argument showing (i) it suffices to test N_E = N_F, (ii) the pathological norm is extremal among non-archimedean norms on k², and (iii) Cₚ is universal among valued fields for this purpose.","owner":"prover-wave1-node1"}
