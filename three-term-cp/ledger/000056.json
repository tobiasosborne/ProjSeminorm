The pathological norm on Cp^2 is constructed as N(x,y) = r_inf * sup_n |x + lambda_n * y| / r_n, where (lambda_n, r_n) is a chain of nested empty balls in Cp with r_n decreasing to r_inf \u003e 0. Different chains yield genuinely different norms with different unit balls and different extremal behaviors. The statement uses the definite article ('the pathological norm') suggesting a unique, specific norm, but does not specify: (a) which chain (lambda_n, r_n) is intended, or (b) that the claim is for ALL norms arising from this construction class.\n\nThis ambiguity matters for the proof strategies in children 1.4.1-1.4.4, which invoke properties of 'the' norm (chain structure, specific cancellation behavior). Different chains can produce different cancellation patterns, so a proof that works for one specific chain might not generalize.\n\nSUGGESTED FIX: Replace 'the pathological norm N' with 'every non-archimedean norm N on Cp^2 of the form N(x,y) = r_inf * sup_n |x+lambda_n*y|/r_n arising from an empty-intersection chain (lambda_n, r_n)' — or, if a specific chain is intended, specify it explicitly.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
