For any norm N_E on V with a norming functional φ for e₁ (i.e., ‖φ‖≤1 and |φ(e₁)|=1), the cost C ≥ 1 follows by: C = Σ N_E(v_j)·N_F(w_j) ≥ Σ |φ(v_j)|·N_F(w_j) ≥ N_F(Σ φ(v_j)·w_j) = |φ(e₁)|·N_F(f) = 1. This proves CP for all pairs (N_E, N_F) where N_E admits FDNP at e₁. FDNP holds for: (a) all archimedean norms (Hahn-Banach), (b) all norms over spherically complete NA fields (Ingleton 1952), (c) all finite-dimensional norms where the base field admits Hahn-Banach. The RESIDUAL OPEN CASE: N_E fails FDNP at e₁, which requires k non-spherically-complete (e.g., ℂ_p) and N_E a specific pathological norm. Strategies A3 and the two-norm cost analysis (node 1.4.5) target this residual case.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"7eec70cb43bad2d0d59ee3390b8e8646eb33d638850422dd59272b5fb9438154","created":"2026-02-10T11:56:43.541414486Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
