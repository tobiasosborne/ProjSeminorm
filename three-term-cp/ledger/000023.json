N(αw₁+βw₂) ≥ |α|N(w₁) fails when |α|N(w₁)=|β|N(w₂) and cancellation occurs in the ultrametric norm. Precisely: N(αw₁+βw₂) ≤ max(|α|N(w₁),|β|N(w₂)), with strict inequality possible when the maximum terms cancel. This is where the pathological norm bites — the chain structure allows unexpected cancellations. This case requires deeper analysis.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d29e83e311ecda72d0202dd077cd0b116125900094bbf16c1d0c0aed80321315","created":"2026-02-10T10:39:00.848619076Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
