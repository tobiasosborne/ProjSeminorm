{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-10T11:01:37.893882364Z","challenge_id":"ch-fd99c41a25852d9f","node_id":"1.5","target":"dependencies","reason":"UNDEFINED COST AND MISSING DEPENDENCY ON NODE 1.2.\n\nThe statement says 'Find explicit alpha,beta,a,b,p,q,r,s in Cp with ps!=qr such that the 3-term cost C \u003c 1.' But C is never defined in this node. The cost formula comes from node 1.2:\n\n  C = N(s/D-alpha*a,-alpha*b)*N(p,q) + N(-q/D-beta*a,-beta*b)*N(r,s) + N(a,b)*N(alpha*p+beta*r,alpha*q+beta*s)\n\nwhere D = ps-qr. Without a dependency on 1.2, the statement is incomplete -- 'the 3-term cost C' is a dangling reference.\n\nMoreover, even with the dependency, the cost C depends on a norm N on Cp^2 that is also unspecified. The existential search should be over (norm N, parameters alpha,beta,a,b,p,q,r,s), not just the 8 scalar parameters. Different non-archimedean norms on Cp^2 give different values of C for the same parameters, so the choice of norm is an essential part of any counterexample. The children (1.5.1-1.5.3) inherit this gap; only 1.5.4 partially specifies a norm (p=2, chain converging to sqrt(2)).\n\nSUGGESTED FIX: (1) Add an explicit dependency on node 1.2 for the cost formula. (2) Amend the statement to: 'Find an explicit non-archimedean norm N on Cp^2 and explicit alpha,beta,a,b,p,q,r,s in Cp with ps!=qr such that C(N; alpha,beta,a,b,p,q,r,s) \u003c 1.'","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
