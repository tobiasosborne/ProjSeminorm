The verification context claims 'sqrt(2) exists in Q_2 (2-adic completion) since x^2-2 has a root by Hensel's lemma.' BOTH claims are problematic.\n\n(1) sqrt(2) does NOT exist in Q_2. Proof: If x^2 = 2 in Q_2, then |x|_2^2 = |2|_2 = 1/2, so |x|_2 = 2^{-1/2}. But the value group of Q_2 is {2^n : n in Z}, and 2^{-1/2} is not in this set. Hensel's lemma fails for f(x)=x^2-2 over Z_2: the reduction mod 2 gives x^2 = 0 (a double root), violating the simple root hypothesis. At a=0: |f(0)|_2 = |2|_2 = 1/2 but |f'(0)|_2^2 = 0, fails. At a=1: |f(1)|_2 = 1 but |f'(1)|_2^2 = 1/4, and 1 \u003c 1/4 is false.\n\n(2) sqrt(2) DOES exist in C_2 (completion of algebraic closure of Q_2). But then a chain of closed balls B(q_n, r_n) in C_2 with q_n -\u003e sqrt(2) and r_n -\u003e r_inf \u003e 0 necessarily has NON-EMPTY intersection: for large n, |sqrt(2) - q_n|_2 \u003c r_inf \u003c= r_n, so sqrt(2) is in all B(q_n, r_n) for large n. A convergent chain cannot witness non-spherical-completeness.\n\n(3) Chains witnessing non-spherical-completeness of C_2 require centers forming a PSEUDO-CONVERGENT sequence with NO limit in C_2. The pseudo-limit is a type-2 point on the Berkovich line, not an algebraic element like sqrt(2). The node conflates sqrt(2) not being in Q_2 (true) with the chain pseudo-limit not being in C_2 (the actual requirement for empty intersection).\n\nCONSEQUENCE: The proposed numerical experiment is not well-defined as stated. The chain must be specified using a genuine pseudo-convergent sequence without limit in C_2, not convergent rational approximations to an algebraic number.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
