The title says 'CONVEXITY / OPTIMIZATION' but the node never establishes any convexity property of C. Over a non-archimedean field k, the standard archimedean notion of convexity (f(tx+(1-t)y) ≤ tf(x)+(1-t)f(y) for t∈[0,1]) is not directly applicable because [0,1]⊂k is not a connected interval — it is a totally disconnected subset (for p-adic k, the elements of [0,1]∩k are a Cantor-like set). The non-archimedean substitute is the theory of 'o_k-convex' sets (subsets stable under o_k-linear combinations, where o_k is the valuation ring), but this does not produce the familiar min/max properties of convex real-valued functions. The node invokes the language of optimization without the mathematical infrastructure (convexity, compactness of sublevel sets, coercivity) that makes optimization arguments work.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
