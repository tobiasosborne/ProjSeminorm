The inherited norm on a 2D subspace of a general normed space is simply the restriction of the ambient norm — there is no reason it must be of the specific chain construction N(x,y) = r_inf * sup_n |x+lambda_n*y|/r_n. The correct statement should say 'the inherited norm, which is an arbitrary k-norm on k^2' (or 'an arbitrary non-archimedean norm on k^2' when working over non-archimedean fields). The term 'pathological-type' conflates the general case with a specific construction and could mislead the prover into using structural properties of the chain norm that do not hold for general 2D norms.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
