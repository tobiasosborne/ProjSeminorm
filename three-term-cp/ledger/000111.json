The entire strategic value of this node rests on the claim that inf_{(a,b)} C(a,b) is attained at b=0 (making the representation collinear, where cost=1 is proved). But NO argument, heuristic, or evidence is provided for this claim. The statement says 'Show minimum occurs at b=0 (collinear, cost=1) or at the boundary of parameter regions' — but the second alternative ('boundary of parameter regions') is vacuous. The ultrametric structure partitions k² into infinitely many regions (determined by the chain (λₙ,rₙ) via conditions like |a/b - λₙ| \u003c rₙ or |a/b - λₙ| ≥ rₙ), and EVERY point of k² lies on the boundary of some region (since the regions are clopen in the non-archimedean topology, their boundaries in the Berkovich sense are dense). Thus 'minimum at b=0 or at a boundary' is equivalent to 'minimum exists somewhere,' which is a tautology. Without a proof (or even a plausible mechanism) for why b=0 should be the minimizer, this node contributes nothing beyond restating the desired conclusion.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
