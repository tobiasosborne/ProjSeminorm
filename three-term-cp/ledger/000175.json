{"type":"node_created","timestamp":"2026-02-10T11:59:00.92749567Z","node":{"id":"1.5.1.1","type":"claim","statement":"APPROACH B1: STANDARD BASIS SEARCH (TWO-NORM). Set w₁=e₁, w₂=e₂ (so p=1,q=0,r=0,s=1,D=1). Define r_E=N_E(0,1), r_F=N_F(0,1). The two-norm cost from parent node 1.5 specializes to: C = N_E(1-αa,-αb)·N_F(1,0) + N_E(-βa,-βb)·N_F(0,1) + N_E(a,b)·N_F(α,β) = N_E(1-αa,-αb) + |β|·N_E(a,b)·r_F + N_E(a,b)·N_F(α,β). This corrects the prior single-norm formulation: term 1 uses N_E, term 2 factors as |β|·N_E(a,b)·r_F (where r_F=N_F(0,1), NOT r_E), and term 3 is N_E(a,b)·N_F(α,β) with two independent norms. The symbol r₀ from the prior formulation was ambiguous (conflating r_E and r_F); it is now eliminated. Key subcase a=0: gives non-degenerate representation v₁=(1,-αb), v₂=(0,-βb), v₃=(0,b) for any b≠0, (α,β)≠(0,0). Cost becomes C = N_E(1,-αb) + |β|·|b|·r_E·r_F + |b|·r_E·N_F(α,β). The two-norm setting allows r_E and r_F to vary independently, providing extra degrees of freedom unavailable in single-norm searches. Prior single-norm searches found C=1 at all tested optima (CROSS_PROPERTY_REPORT S2.2); the asymmetric case N_E≠N_F remains the open search frontier.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9b7d6e761766a22c2de48d208dd139e094a8c124730da7f99ad6883e0bd88e42","created":"2026-02-10T11:59:00.92748336Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
