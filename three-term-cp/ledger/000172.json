When |c₁|=|α|·N_E(v₃) (and/or |c₂|=|β|·N_E(v₃)), the isosceles property does NOT apply: we only get N_E(v₁)≤|c₁|=|α|·N_E(v₃), with possible strict inequality from cancellation in N_E. The deficit ε₁=|c₁|·N_F(w₁)-T₁≥0 must be compensated by T₃=N_E(v₃)·N_F(αw₁+βw₂). The double-equality case (both j=1,2) is hardest: T₃ must cover both deficits simultaneously. This is STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL to the obstruction at node 1.4.2.4: there, N_F(αw₁+βw₂) suffers cancellation when |α|·N_F(w₁)=|β|·N_F(w₂); here, N_E(c_j·e_j-multiplier·v₃) suffers cancellation when |c_j|=|multiplier|·N_E(v₃). Both are instances of ultrametric cancellation at equal-norm summands. In the two-norm setting (N_E≠N_F), the v-side and w-side cancellations are governed by independent norms, so no structural coupling prevents both from being large simultaneously — making the two-norm equality case potentially harder than the single-norm case. Over ℂ_p with value group p^Q, the equality locus {|c_j|=|multiplier|·N_E(v₃)} is codimension-1 (a single valuation condition), and the piecewise-linear minimum of C generically lives on such boundaries. Resolution requires either: (a) a coupling argument exploiting the tensor equation to show v-side and w-side cancellations cannot both be large, or (b) a direct T₃-compensation argument showing N_E(v₃)·N_F(αw₁+βw₂) is large enough on the equality locus.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5925d8abd335cf288317a83bbfe2e948d4c3b7f6829af03d8ea44af223b99a9b","created":"2026-02-10T11:57:44.152958264Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
