The correct cost is:\n\n  C = N_E(s/D-alpha*a,-alpha*b)*N_F(p,q) + N_E(-q/D-beta*a,-beta*b)*N_F(r,s) + N_E(a,b)*N_F(alpha*p+beta*r,alpha*q+beta*s)\n\nThis does NOT affect the algebraic derivation of v1 and v2 (which is verified correct), but does affect the optimization problem studied in downstream nodes 1.4.x and 1.5.x. Already challenged at 1.1; noted here for traceability.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
