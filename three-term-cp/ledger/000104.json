This is mathematically imprecise and too sweeping. Three specific issues:\n\n=== GAP 1: MISSTATEMENT OF THE CLASSICAL DUALITY APPROACH ===\n\nThe node states: \"each term N(u)N(w) \u003e= |phi(u)||phi(w)| for any functional phi with ||phi|| \u003c= 1.\"\n\nThis applies a dual functional to BOTH tensor factors. The actual classical approach applies phi to ONE factor only:\n\n  (1) Find phi in E* with ||phi||_{N_E} = 1 and phi(e) = N_E(e) = 1 [norming for e].\n  (2) Apply phi tensor id to the tensor equation: sum_j phi(v_j) w_j = phi(e) f = f.\n  (3) Then: sum N_E(v_j) N_F(w_j) \u003e= sum |phi(v_j)| N_F(w_j)  [since ||phi|| \u003c= 1]\n                                     \u003e= N_F(sum phi(v_j) w_j)   [triangle inequality in F]\n                                     = N_F(f) = 1.\n\nThis one-sided duality approach requires a norming functional on E ONLY. The node's description of applying phi to both factors is not how the classical CP proof works. The correct approach is strictly weaker in its requirements: it needs FDNP for N_E alone, not for both norms.\n\n=== GAP 2: FDNP FAILS ONLY FOR SOME NORMS OVER SOME FIELDS ===\n\nThe node says \"no norming functional exists (FDNP fails)\" as if this is universal. In fact:\n\n(a) Over ARCHIMEDEAN fields (R, C): Hahn-Banach holds unconditionally. Norming functionals always exist. The duality approach succeeds for ALL norms. (Already proved in RCLike.lean.)\n\n(b) Over SPHERICALLY COMPLETE non-archimedean fields (Q_p, finite extensions of Q_p): Ingleton's theorem (1952) guarantees Hahn-Banach extension. Norming functionals exist for ALL norms on k^2. The duality approach succeeds for ALL norms over these fields.\n\n(c) Over NON-SPHERICALLY-COMPLETE fields (C_p, Cp(t), etc.): FDNP fails for SOME norms (the pathological chain-based norms with empty intersection). But it does NOT fail for all norms — e.g., the sup norm on C_p^2 admits norming functionals.\n\nTherefore the duality approach proves CP for:\n  - All (N_E, N_F) when k is archimedean or spherically complete.\n  - All (N_E, N_F) where N_E admits a norming functional for e_1, even over C_p.\n\nThe ONLY remaining case is: k is non-spherically-complete AND N_E is a norm failing FDNP at e_1. This is a significant but bounded residual, not a \"dead end\" for the entire strategy.\n\n=== GAP 3: TWO-NORM SETTING FURTHER NARROWS THE OBSTRUCTION ===\n\nPer the corrected reduction (nodes 1.1 and 1.4.5), the problem uses two independent norms N_E and N_F. The classical duality approach (Gap 1) requires a norming functional for e_1 in (k^2, N_E) only. There is NO requirement on N_F.\n\nThis means: even if one of the two norms is pathological, as long as N_E (the norm on the E-side where e lives) admits norming functionals, the duality approach succeeds. The norm N_F can be completely arbitrary.\n\n=== CONCLUSION ===\n\n\"Record as dead end\" should be replaced with a more nuanced assessment:\n\nSTRATEGY A1 SUCCESSFULLY PROVES CP for all pairs (N_E, N_F) where N_E admits a norming functional for e_1. This covers: (1) all archimedean fields, (2) all spherically complete non-archimedean fields, and (3) many norms over non-spherically-complete fields. The strategy is blocked ONLY when k is non-spherically-complete and N_E specifically fails FDNP at e_1. The residual open case should be explicitly identified rather than the entire approach being dismissed.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
