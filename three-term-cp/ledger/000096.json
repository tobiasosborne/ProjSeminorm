Node 1.4.5 uses two results from ancestor nodes without declaring them as dependencies: (1) The normalization N_E(1,0) = N_F(1,0) = 1 comes from node 1.1's reduction (WLOG e = e_1, f = e_1 with unit norm). (2) The cost formula -- the specific expressions for v_1 = (s/D - alpha*a, -alpha*b), v_2 = (-q/D - beta*a, -beta*b), and w_3 = (alpha*p + beta*r, alpha*q + beta*s) -- is derived in node 1.2's parametrization. Without formal dependency declarations, the proof graph does not track these logical prerequisites. SUGGESTED FIX: Add formal dependencies on nodes 1.1 and 1.2.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
