The node states 'the CP conjecture for 3-term dependent representations reduces to [C \u003e= 1 with ps-qr nonzero].' But 3-term dependent representations include the collinear case (dim span{w1,w2,w3}=1), which forces D=ps-qr=0 and is not covered by the C \u003e= 1 formula. The correct statement is: CP for 3-term dependent representations reduces to (A) C \u003e= 1 for all parameters with D \\!= 0 [this node], PLUS (B) the collinear case [already proved in CancellationTrick.lean]. The word 'reduces' is technically correct only modulo this separately-handled case. This is a minor precision issue since the collinear case is proved, but the node should explicitly acknowledge this decomposition for completeness.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
