Find explicit α,β,a,b,p,q,r,s∈Cₚ with ps≠qr such that the 3-term cost C \u003c 1. This would disprove CP.","new_statement":"CASE B: COUNTEREXAMPLE SEARCH. Find a valued field k, norms N_E, N_F on k² with N_E(e₁)=N_F(e₁)=1, and parameters α,β,a,b,p,q,r,s ∈ k with D := ps-qr ≠ 0, such that C := N_E(s/D - αa, -αb)·N_F(p,q) + N_E(-q/D - βa, -βb)·N_F(r,s) + N_E(a,b)·N_F(αp+βr, αq+βs) \u003c 1 (referencing the parametrization from node 1.2). This would disprove CP. Prior numerical searches in the single-norm case (N_E = N_F) over ℂ_p found C = 1 at all tested optima (CROSS_PROPERTY_REPORT S2.2), suggesting CP may be true. The asymmetric case N_E ≠ N_F has not been explored and represents the remaining search frontier for a potential counterexample.","owner":"prover-wave3-node1.5"}
