The w's span W by hypothesis, and e⊗f ∈ E⊗W (since all wj ∈ W) forces f ∈ W when e ≠ 0. Valid.\n(b) E reduces to V = span{e,v3} ≅ k^2. From the tensor equation, collecting by the basis {w1,w2}: v1+αv3 = c1·e and v2+βv3 = c2·e (where f = c1w1+c2w2). Hence v1,v2,v3 ∈ span{e,v3}. Valid.\n(c) WLOG ‖e‖=‖f‖=1 by homogeneity of the inequality. Valid.\n(d) WLOG e corresponds to e1=(1,0) in V-coordinates and f corresponds to e1=(1,0) in W-coordinates. Valid as coordinate choices.\n\nWHAT IS INCORRECT:\n(1) E=F with the SAME norm. After reduction, V ⊂ E has norm N_V = ‖·‖_E|_V and W ⊂ F has norm N_W = ‖·‖_F|_W. These are two independent norms on two different spaces. No argument is given for why N_V = N_W. In a potential counterexample, E and F could be completely different normed spaces, so their 2D subspaces inherit different norms.\n(2) e=f. Writing e=f requires identifying V with W, which requires N_V = N_W. Without this, \"e=f\" conflates two vectors in distinct normed spaces. Moreover, e⊗e has special symmetry (the swap map E⊗E → E⊗E fixes it) that e⊗f lacks, so this identification imposes a non-trivial constraint on the problem.\n\nIMPACT ON PROOF TREE: Node 1.2 parametrizes the cost using ONE norm N for both v-factors and w-factors:\n  C = N(s/D-αa,-αb)·N(p,q) + N(-q/D-βa,-βb)·N(r,s) + N(a,b)·N(αp+βr,αq+βs)\nThe correct version with two norms would be:\n  C = N_V(s/D-αa,-αb)·N_W(p,q) + N_V(-q/D-βa,-βb)·N_W(r,s) + N_V(a,b)·N_W(αp+βr,αq+βs)\nThis is a genuinely different optimization problem. The ultrametric case analysis in 1.4.x and the counterexample search in 1.5.x are all studying a restricted special case.\n\nSUGGESTED FIX: Replace the claim with the correct reduction: \"WLOG V=(k^2,N_E) and W=(k^2,N_F) with e=e1, f=e1, ‖e1‖_{N_E}=‖e1‖_{N_F}=1, where N_E and N_F are two (possibly distinct) non-archimedean norms on k^2.\" Then update 1.2 to parametrize with two norms.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
