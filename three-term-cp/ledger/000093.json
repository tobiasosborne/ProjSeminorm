Node 1.3.1 logically depends on both node 1.1 (the WLOG reduction to V=(k^2,N_E), W=(k^2,N_F)) and node 1.2 (the algebraic parametrization of v_i, w_j in terms of 8 parameters). Neither is declared as a formal dependency. This matters because: (1) Node 1.1 is still pending/unvalidated, so the reduction to two norms on k^2 that 1.3.1 relies upon is not yet verified. (2) Node 1.2 has an open challenge (ch-1d68d15be6c4cf2b) noting that the quantifier 'every 3-term dependent representation' overstates coverage and should be restricted to dim(span{w1,w2,w3})=2, since D=ps-qr\\!=0 excludes the collinear case. Node 1.3.1 inherits this quantifier gap silently. FIX: Add formal dependencies on 1.1 and 1.2.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
