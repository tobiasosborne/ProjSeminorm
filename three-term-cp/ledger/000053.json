This empirical evidence, while not a proof, is a strong signal that C \u003e= 1 may always hold in the single-norm setting. Node 1.5 does not acknowledge or analyze this prior evidence at the parent level, nor does it provide a feasibility assessment for the counterexample search.\n\nA well-scoped counterexample search should:\n(1) State what prior searches have explored and their results.\n(2) Identify specific regions of parameter space NOT yet searched (e.g., non-standard basis choices for w1,w2 as in 1.5.2, or different chain norms).\n(3) Provide heuristic reasoning for why a counterexample might exist in those unexplored regions.\n\nWithout this, the node risks directing effort into a search that prior evidence suggests will fail. The children (1.5.1-1.5.4) provide different search strategies, which is good, but the parent should synthesize the prior evidence and direct strategy accordingly.\n\nThis is rated minor because feasibility assessment is strategic guidance rather than a logical requirement, and the empirical evidence is already recorded at 1.5.4.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
