Per the corrected nodes 1.1 and 1.4.5, the correct two-norm cost is:\n  C = N_E(1-αa,-αb)·N_F(1,0) + N_E(-βa,-βb)·N_F(0,1) + N_E(a,b)·N_F(α,β)\n    = N_E(1-αa,-αb) + |β|·N_E(a,b)·N_F(0,1) + N_E(a,b)·N_F(α,β)\n\nThe crucial difference: in the third term, N(a,b)·N(α,β) becomes N_E(a,b)·N_F(α,β) where N_E and N_F are INDEPENDENT norms. With two norms, one can independently tune r_E := N_E(0,1) and r_F := N_F(0,1) (and more generally the full norm shapes). The parent node 1.5 explicitly identifies 'the asymmetric case N_E ≠ N_F' as 'the unexplored frontier.' This node should state the two-norm formula and explore the extra degrees of freedom.\n\nFurthermore, the single symbol r₀ is ambiguous: in the second term, it represents N_F(0,1); but N_E(a,b) (which appears in terms 2 and 3) involves N_E(0,1), a separate quantity. This conflation masks the two-norm structure.\n\nConcretely, the two-norm a=0 cost becomes:\n  C = N_E(1,-αb) + |β|·|b|·r_E·r_F + |b|·r_E·N_F(α,β)\nwhere r_E = N_E(0,1), r_F = N_F(0,1). Choosing r_E very small while keeping r_F moderate (or vice versa) is a search direction unavailable in the single-norm setting.\n\nNOTE: The algebraic derivation of the cost formula is CORRECT for the single-norm case; this challenge concerns the scope restriction, not the algebra.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
