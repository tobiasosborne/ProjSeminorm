By the parametrization of node 1.2 (updated per node 1.1 to use two independent norms N_E on V and N_F on W), the CP conjecture for 3-term dependent representations reduces to the following: for all valued fields k, all pairs (N_E, N_F) of norms on k^2 with N_E(e_1) = N_F(e_1) = 1, and all parameters (p, q, r, s, alpha, beta, a, b) with ps - qr nonzero, the two-norm cost function C(N_E, N_F; params) := N_E(v_1) N_F(w_1) + N_E(v_2) N_F(w_2) + N_E(v_3) N_F(w_3) satisfies C \u003e= 1, where v_i, w_i are given by node 1.2. The key structural point: N_E and N_F are independent norms, so the optimization landscape for inf C has strictly more degrees of freedom than the single-norm case N_E = N_F. Node 1.4 pursues a lower bound C \u003e= 1 (beginning with the ultrametric inequality and the isosceles property of non-archimedean norms as the main tools), while node 1.5 searches for parameters and norm pairs achieving C \u003c 1. These sub-trees are complementary: success in either resolves the 3-term CP question.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"748491f01daca89df45202fc0520786e7c3afa410349d85df159b287f945f602","created":"2026-02-10T11:15:54.039965997Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
