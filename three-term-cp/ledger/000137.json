Examining that report (Section 2.2, 'Strategy A2: Contrapositive'), Agent Alpha's actual computation was:\n\n- A SINGLE specific parametrization of 3-term dependent representations, not the general 8-parameter family from node 1.2\n- Only 2 free parameters (alpha, beta) out of 8\n- Symbolic/analytic optimization, not a numerical grid search\n- Found the trivial minimum at alpha=beta=0 (the 1-term representation) with cost=1\n- No other optima were found or tested\n\nThe claim 'found cost=1 at every tested optimum' is technically correct but deeply misleading: the single tested optimum was the trivial one in a 2-dimensional slice of an 8-dimensional parameter space. This constitutes essentially zero numerical coverage.\n\nSPECIFIC GAPS:\n(a) The full 8-parameter cost from node 1.2 (p,q,r,s,alpha,beta,a,b with D=ps-qr!=0) was never evaluated numerically.\n(b) No grid search, random sampling, or gradient-based optimization was attempted.\n(c) The two-norm case (N_E != N_F) was never considered at all.\n(d) No specific 2-adic chain was instantiated; the computation used abstract norm properties.\n\nThe node's directive to 'reproduce and extend' is predicated on there being meaningful prior work to reproduce. There is not.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
