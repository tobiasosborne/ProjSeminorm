Node 1.4.3 uses a single norm N for both v-factors and w-factors, but the correct formulation (node 1.4.5, validated) requires two independent norms N_E on V and N_F on W. In the two-norm setting, the isosceles case analysis becomes harder because: (a) cancellation in N_E(v_1) = N_E(c_1*e_1 - alpha*v_3) is governed by the ultrametric structure of N_E, while (b) cancellation in N_F(w_3) = N_F(alpha*w_1 + beta*w_2) is governed by the independent norm N_F. No structural relationship connects these two cancellation phenomena when N_E != N_F. The non-equality cases still work (the argument only uses N_E for v-terms and N_F for w-terms independently), but the equality cases become even harder since a potential counterexample could exploit N_E/N_F mismatch. Filing as minor since this is inherited from parent and already tracked at nodes 1.1 and 1.4.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
