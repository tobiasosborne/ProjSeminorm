This discretizes the VALUE SET of the norm but does not by itself determine the jump structure.\n\n(2) The chain structure (lambda_n, r_n) of the specific norm N on k^2, which determines WHERE in parameter space the norm jumps. Different chain norms on the same field C_p have different jump loci.\n\nWhat makes C piecewise-constant as a function of b is NOT the p-adic valuation per se, but the fact that ultrametric norms on finite-dimensional spaces are locally constant on the complement of a union of codimension-1 loci (the 'walls' where competing terms in the norm's definition exchange dominance). This holds for ANY ultrametric norm on k^2, not just chain norms, and the precise wall structure depends on the norm, not just the base field's valuation.\n\nThe statement should say something like: 'The ultrametric structure of N makes C(b) piecewise constant as a function of b, with jump loci at the finitely many (per bounded region) thresholds where the dominant term in N_E changes.'","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
