The node claims 'C is piecewise-multiplicative' as a function of v₃=(a,b). This is false. C = T₁ + T₂ + T₃ where each Tᵢ = N(vᵢ)·N(wᵢ) is a product of norm values. Even if each Tᵢ is individually piecewise-multiplicative in (a,b) (meaning on each ultrametric region, Tᵢ(λa,λb) = |λ|^{dᵢ}·Tᵢ(a,b) for some degree dᵢ), their SUM is NOT piecewise-multiplicative. Concretely: if T₁ = |a|² and T₂ = |b|², then T₁ + T₂ is not multiplicative in any scaling variable unless T₁ and T₂ have the same homogeneity degree AND one dominates the other ultrametrically on each region. In general, the three terms T₁, T₂, T₃ have DIFFERENT homogeneity degrees in (a,b) on a given region (T₃ is linear in N(a,b) while T₁ and T₂ depend on (a,b) through offsets like (s/D - αa, -αb)), so their sum cannot be piecewise-multiplicative. This error invalidates the entire analytical framework proposed by the node: the optimization techniques for piecewise-multiplicative functions (e.g., checking vertices of the tropical subdivision) do not apply to C.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
