The strategy correctly handles the non-equality cases: when |c_1| != |alpha|*N_E(v_3), isosceles gives N_E(v_1) = max(|c_1|, |alpha|*N_E(v_3)), and in all 4 strict-inequality combinations for (v_1, v_2), T_1+T_2 \u003e= collapsed_cost \u003e= 1, so C \u003e= 1 follows trivially with T_3 \u003e= 0. However, the strategy provides NO mechanism for the equality cases |c_j| = |multiplier|*N_E(v_3), where: (1) Isosceles does NOT apply -- we only get N_E(v_1) \u003c= |c_1|, with possible strict inequality from cancellation. (2) The deficit epsilon_j = |c_j| - N_E(v_j) \u003e 0 must be compensated by T_3 = N_E(v_3)*N_F(w_3). (3) Whether T_3 compensates depends on norm fine structure not analyzed here. The double-equality case |c_1|=|alpha|*N_E(v_3) AND |c_2|=|beta|*N_E(v_3) is particularly hard: both T_1, T_2 fall below their collapsed counterparts, and T_3 must cover both deficits. This is the SAME obstruction as node 1.4.2.4 (cancellation at equal norms), viewed from the v-side. The strategy relocates the difficulty without resolving it. Over C_p with dense value group p^Q, the equality locus is codimension-1, and the piecewise minimum of C typically lives at region boundaries -- exactly these equality points. The claim to derive C \u003e= 1 in each region is unsubstantiated for the equality regions where the minimum likely lives.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
