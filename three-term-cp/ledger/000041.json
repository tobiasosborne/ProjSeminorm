As established by the critical challenge ch-d076e166088 on node 1.1, the correct reduction yields two INDEPENDENT norms: N_E on V = span{e, v3} (subset of E) and N_F on W = span{w1, w2} (subset of F).\n\nThe correct dichotomy should be:\n  (A') For ALL pairs (N_E, N_F) of non-archimedean norms on k^2, and all parameter choices, C(N_E, N_F) \u003e= 1; OR\n  (B') There exist norms N_E, N_F and parameters such that C(N_E, N_F) \u003c 1.\n\nThe single-norm version is a strict SPECIAL CASE of the two-norm problem. If one proves C(N,N) \u003e= 1 for all N and all parameters (Case A with one norm), this does NOT establish C(N_E, N_F) \u003e= 1 for independent N_E, N_F. Conversely, if one finds a counterexample with N_E != N_F, Case B of node 1.3 would miss it because the node only considers a single N.\n\nThis gap is not cosmetic; the optimization landscape for C(N_E, N_F) with two independent norms has strictly more degrees of freedom than C(N, N). The downstream nodes 1.4 and 1.5, which study the single-norm case, may be solving the wrong problem.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
