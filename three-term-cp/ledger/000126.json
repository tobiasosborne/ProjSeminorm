This conflates a single term in the supremum with the supremum itself.\n\nDETAILED COMPUTATION: For the chain norm N(x,y) = r_inf * sup_n |x+lambda_n*y|/r_n, define x = -1/c and M(x) = max{n: x in B-bar(lambda_n, r_n)}. Then:\n- For n \u003c= M: |x-lambda_n| \u003c= r_n, so |x-lambda_n|/r_n \u003c= 1.\n- For n \u003e= M+1: by ultrametric, |x-lambda_n| = |x-lambda_{M+1}| = d for all such n (since lambda_n in B-bar(lambda_{M+1}, r_{M+1}) and |x-lambda_{M+1}| = d \u003e r_{M+1} \u003e= |lambda_n - lambda_{M+1}|).\n- So sup_{n \u003e= M+1} d/r_n = d/r_inf \u003e 1, which dominates the terms for n \u003c= M.\n- Therefore: N(1,c) = r_inf * |c| * d/r_inf = |c| * d = |1 + c*lambda_{M+1}|.\n\nCONSEQUENCE: N(1,lambda_m) = |1 + lambda_m * lambda_{M(-1/lambda_m)+1}|, with the bound N(1,lambda_m) \u003e |lambda_m| * r_{M+1} \u003e |lambda_m| * r_inf.\n\nThe norm is determined by the EXIT INDEX of -1/lambda_m from the chain, NOT by 'near-cancellation at the m-th chain point.' The individual term |1+lambda_m^2|/r_m is just one term in the supremum and is generically DOMINATED by the tail terms. Making this single term small (which requires lambda_m^2 approx -1, an arithmetic coincidence with no chain-structural basis) does not reduce the supremum.\n\nThe 'resonance' idea as stated has no mathematically coherent mechanism for making N_F(w_j) small.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
