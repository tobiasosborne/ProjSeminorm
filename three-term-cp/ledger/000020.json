For ultrametric norm N on k², vectors u,w∈k², and scalar α∈k: N(u)N(w) + N(αu)N(w) ≥ N(u+αu)N(w) is trivially false in general (wrong direction). The real question: does N(c₁e₁-αv₃)N(w₁) + N(v₃)N(αw₁+βw₂) ≥ N(c₁e₁)N(w₁) = |c₁|N(w₁) hold when the third term absorbs the cost of splitting?","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"3e8ee25ff3678c4e6c62589a2be31549b205ba0085b23373d147408f0b746703","created":"2026-02-10T10:39:00.848599042Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
