This contrasts with node 1.5.4, which at least references prior numerical evidence (Agent Alpha's search finding C=1 at all optima).\n\nAdditionally, the node should specify: (a) whether it targets single-norm (N_E = N_F) or two-norm; (b) what quantitative meaning 'small' has for N_F(w_j); (c) how the approach interacts with the proved independent-case lower bound |c1|N_F(w1) + |c2|N_F(w2) \u003e= 1.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
