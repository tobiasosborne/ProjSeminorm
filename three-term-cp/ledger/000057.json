{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-10T11:05:14.493547427Z","challenge_id":"ch-92778f298a29ec21","node_id":"1.4","target":"completeness","reason":"SINGLE-NORM RESTRICTION LIMITS APPLICABILITY (inherited from ch-d076e166088 on node 1.1). Node 1.4 studies C \u003e= 1 using a SINGLE norm N for both the v-factors and w-factors:\n\n  C = N(v1)*N(w1) + N(v2)*N(w2) + N(v3)*N(w3) \u003e= 1\n\nThe critical challenge ch-d076e166088 on node 1.1 establishes that the correct reduction from the general conjecture (node 1) yields TWO independent norms N_E on V = span{e,v3} in E and N_F on W = span{w1,w2} in F. The correct cost is:\n\n  C = N_E(v1)*N_F(w1) + N_E(v2)*N_F(w2) + N_E(v3)*N_F(w3) \u003e= 1\n\nThe single-norm case (N_E = N_F = N) is a strict special case with additional symmetry (e.g., the swap E\u003c-\u003eF is an isometry). The two-norm problem is a genuinely different optimization problem with more degrees of freedom: a potential counterexample could exploit the mismatch between N_E and N_F to achieve C \u003c 1 even when C \u003e= 1 holds for all single-norm instances.\n\nIMPACT: Even a complete proof of node 1.4 would not resolve the general conjecture (node 1) without an additional argument showing the single-norm case is extremal among all pairs (N_E, N_F).\n\nNOTE: This challenge is filed for traceability. The root cause is at node 1.1 (ch-d076e166088). If the reduction in 1.1 is corrected, node 1.4 should be updated to use two norms.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
