{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-10T11:25:35.040800672Z","node_id":"1.3.1","note":"ACCEPTED WITH THREE NON-BLOCKING CHALLENGES (ch-7032406d44f1ef15, ch-310503b91be9eee6, ch-508224ac6b3d4613). The core mathematical content is correct: (1) The two-norm update of node 1.2's parametrization is valid — the algebraic derivation of v_i, w_j is norm-independent, so replacing single N with (N_E, N_F) is straightforward. (2) The cost function C = N_E(v_1)N_F(w_1) + N_E(v_2)N_F(w_2) + N_E(v_3)N_F(w_3) correctly captures the CP condition. (3) The degrees-of-freedom claim is accurate. (4) The complementarity of 1.4 and 1.5 is correctly stated."}
