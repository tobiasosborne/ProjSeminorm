Parent node 1.4 is titled 'CASE A: ULTRAMETRIC LOWER BOUND' and restricts to 'the pathological norm N' over Cp. Node 1.4.5 covers ALL nontrivially valued fields k (including archimedean R, C) and ALL pairs of norms (N_E, N_F) on k^2. Proving 1.4.5 would directly resolve the root conjecture (node 1), making the entire proof tree collapse. This means 1.4.5 is not a strategy for attacking 1.4 (as siblings 1.4.1-1.4.4 are), but a reformulation of the full open problem at the correct generality. This is mathematically fine -- the corrected formulation is the right one -- but the placement as a child of 1.4 (a single-norm ultrametric node) is misleading. Consider either (a) promoting 1.4.5 to a sibling of 1.4 (under 1.3.1), or (b) adding an explicit note that 1.4.5 supersedes 1.4 in scope.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
