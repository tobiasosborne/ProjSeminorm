If this were correct, then C \u003e= 1 would already be known for ALL norms on Cp^2, making node 1.4 trivially true and the entire subtree unnecessary.\n\nHOWEVER, the MEMORY.md records 'FDNP is FALSE over Cp' for the pathological norm, meaning the bidual embedding of (Cp^2, N) is NOT isometric. This directly contradicts the Counterexample.lean claim. The contradiction arises because Hahn-Banach extension from a 1-dimensional subspace to a 2-dimensional space over a non-spherically-complete field can fail: the extension requires finding a value in an intersection of closed balls parametrized by the subspace, and over Cp this intersection can be empty even for a 1-codimension extension (the ball family forms a decreasing chain with inf not attained, and Cp is not spherically complete).\n\nThis creates two possible scenarios:\n(A) FDNP failure means h_bidual genuinely fails for (Cp^2, N), so the duality proof of C \u003e= 1 is blocked, and node 1.4 is a genuinely open problem requiring a non-duality proof. This is the implicit assumption of the proof tree.\n(B) Despite FDNP failure for individual functionals, the cross property might still hold by some other route (algebraic, metric, or optimization-based). Then C \u003e= 1 is true but requires a new proof technique.\n\nNode 1.4 should explicitly state which scenario it assumes and why the claim is not already resolved by known results. The current statement gives no indication of the difficulty level or relationship to existing theory.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
