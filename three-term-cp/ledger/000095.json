The statement says 'Node 1.4 pursues a lower bound C \u003e= 1 (beginning with the ultrametric inequality...)'. However, node 1.4 as currently stated restricts to 'the pathological norm N' (singular) over Cp, not the full two-norm setting over all valued fields that 1.3.1 establishes. It is node 1.4.5 (a corrected child) that uses the two-norm formulation with N_E, N_F over general valued fields. The description is not wrong per se (node 1.4's subtree does pursue the bound), but it could mislead a reader into thinking 1.4's main statement already matches the generality of 1.3.1. Consider clarifying that the corrected formulation is in node 1.4.5.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
