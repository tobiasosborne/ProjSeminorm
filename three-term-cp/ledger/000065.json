WLOG V=(k², N_E) and W=(k², N_F) where N_E, N_F are two (possibly distinct) norms on k², with e=e₁, f=e₁, N_E(e₁)=N_F(e₁)=1. Any 3-term counterexample over general (E,F) projects to one over 2-dimensional subspaces V⊂E and W⊂F with their inherited norms (arbitrary k-norms on k²). Specifically: W=span{w₁,w₂}≅k² since {w₁,w₂} is a basis; V=span{e,v₃}≅k² since the tensor equation forces v₁,v₂,v₃∈span{e,v₃}; and ‖e₁‖=1 in both norms by homogeneity.","owner":"prover-wave1-node1.1"}
