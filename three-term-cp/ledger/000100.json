{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-10T11:25:53.444108358Z","node_id":"1.4.5","note":"VERIFIED CORRECT after thorough review. (1) Cost formula verified: all three terms match node 1.2 parametrization exactly -- v_1=(s/D-alpha*a,-alpha*b), v_2=(-q/D-beta*a,-beta*b), w_3=(alpha*p+beta*r,alpha*q+beta*s). (2) Normalization N_E(1,0)=N_F(1,0)=1 justified by node 1.1 reduction. (3) Status 'genuinely open' is accurate: archimedean case proved (RCLike.lean), non-archimedean case open, FDNP failure blocks duality approach. (4) Two-norm formulation (N_E, N_F) correctly addresses earlier critical challenge on single-norm restriction. (5) External references all verified. Two non-blocking challenges filed: ch-06a2c19a06c (missing deps on 1.1/1.2) and ch-7d5d8c3f461 (scope escalation beyond parent 1.4)."}
