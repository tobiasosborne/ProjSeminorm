The node proposes optimizing C over v₃=(a,b) 'with w₁,w₂,α,β fixed.' But C also depends on (p,q,r,s), which parametrize the basis change from {w₁,w₂} to the representation basis (node 1.2). Even if one could show that for each fixed (p,q,r,s,α,β), the function C(a,b) achieves its minimum at b=0, the INFIMUM over all (p,q,r,s,α,β) of these conditional minima must still be shown to be ≥ 1. The node does not address this second-level optimization at all. In fact, at b=0 (collinear case), C=1 is proved, so the conditional minimum at b=0 is always 1 — but this is circular: one needs to show that C(a,b) ≥ 1 for ALL (a,b), not just that the minimum over (a,b) is at the point where the answer is already known. Furthermore, in the corrected two-norm setting (nodes 1.1, 1.4.5), there is an additional optimization over all pairs (N_E, N_F) of norms, which makes the problem strictly harder.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
